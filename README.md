# Credit Score Prediction using Random Forest Classifier 

##  Overview

This project builds a machine learning model using the **Random Forest Classifier** to predict whether a person is eligible to receive credit from a bank, based on previous financial and demographic details. It leverages the power of ensemble learning for accurate and reliable classification.

##  Objective

To classify individuals as **creditworthy or not** using supervised learning and ensemble modeling with Random Forest, based on historical data such as income, employment, loan history, and credit records.
